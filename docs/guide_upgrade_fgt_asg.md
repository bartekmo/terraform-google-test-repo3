# Guide: Upgrading FortiGate AutoScale Group

After deploying the examples `autoscale_fgt_as_hub`, `autoscale_fgt_lb_sandwich`, or the module `fortigate/fgt_asg_with_function`, you can upgrade the FortiGate (FGT) image version and the [Cloud Function](https://github.com/fortinetdev/terraform-google-cloud-modules/blob/main/docs/guide_function.md) code.

### Upgrading the FortiGate Image Version

The upgrade process depends on how the FGT image is specified in your Terraform configuration:

- Using `image_type`:

    If you specify the image via the variable `image_type`, Terraform will automatically retrieve the latest available image. Simply run the command `terraform apply` and confirm the changes.

- Using `image_type`:

    If the FGT image is set via the variable `image_source`, update this variable with the new image reference. Then, run the command `terraform apply` and confirm the changes.

### Upgrading the Cloud Function (Available in version >= 1.4.1)

The [Cloud Function](https://github.com/fortinetdev/terraform-google-cloud-modules/blob/main/docs/guide_function.md) is continuously updated to support new features and improvements. To benefit from these updates, you can upgrade the Cloud Function code using one of the following methods:

#### 1. If you are using a local copy of the project

If you have cloned or downloaded the source code locally (using `terraform.tfvars` file to deploy), you can manually update the Cloud Function code:

1. Download the latest [`cloud function code file`](https://github.com/fortinetdev/terraform-google-cloud-modules/blob/main/modules/fortigate/fgt_asg_with_function/cloud_function.zip)
2. Replace the existing file at `/modules/fortigate/fgt_asg_with_function/cloud_function.zip`.
3. Re-run `terraform apply` to deploy the updated function.


#### 2. If you are using the project as a module (recommended for version â‰¥ 1.4.1)

If you're using this project as a module, for example, by creating your own `main.tf` file and including the following block:

**Example (initial use without version pinning):**
```
module "autoscale_fgt_lb_sandwich" {
  source = "fortinetdev/cloud-modules/google//examples/autoscale_fgt_lb_sandwich"

  # other parameters
}
```
Terraform will fetch the latest available version at the time of the first `terraform init`. However, this version is **locked** in your `.terraform.lock.hcl` file and will not automatically update, even if newer versions become available later.

To ensure you're using a specific version, or to upgrade to a newer one, you should explicitly specify the version attribute in your module block.

**To upgrade to a newer version:**

Update the `version` field to the desired version number. For example:

```
module "autoscale_fgt_lb_sandwich" {
  source = "fortinetdev/cloud-modules/google//examples/autoscale_fgt_lb_sandwich"
  version = "1.4.1"  # <-- Update this to a new version

  # other parameters
}
```

Then run the following commands to upgrade and apply the changes:
```
terraform init -upgrade
terraform apply
```
