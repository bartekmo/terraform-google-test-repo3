# Example: 3-NIC basic deployment of FortiGate HA active-passive

This example shows how to use the module to deploy FortiGate HA cluster with 2 network interfaces for connections (external and internal) and a single interface for HA sync and management. While a 4-NIC approach matches the usual deployments, since version 7.0 it is possible to use the same interface for both HA sync and dedicated management functions. Using a single NIC for HA sync and management is particulary useful if and additional interface is needed for hybrid connectivity over Interconnect but you want to use a 4 CPU instance size.

The module will detect if you have 3 NICs and will collapse HA sync and management interfaces into one (port3), so explicitly setting variables `ha_port` and `mgmt_port` to "port3" is not required.
